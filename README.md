# Seabed syntax theme

A low contrast syntax theme with a deep sea feel. There is no pure red, orange, and yellow, while the rest of the palette hints heavily towards the blue side of the spectrum.

*Seabed* comes in two distinct packages, a dark and a 'lighter' dark version (see further info below). This is the lighter dark variant.
